# ladybird-scroll-bug
Just a test repo to showcase a bug in Ladybird

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Colored elements in bash
# Maybe the text needs to be long, like, suuuuuper long, so it requires a scrollbar? I hope that's the issue, because I don't know how much more time I can put into figuring out what the exact problem is here. Hopefully someone smarter than me can figure it out!
cd different_colors
# this code means nothing 
# This is just for testing
if [ $(whoami) = 'root' ]; then
	echo "You are root"
fi
cd ..
```
